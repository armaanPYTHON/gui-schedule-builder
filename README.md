# gui-schedule-builder
This basic tkinter GUI helps build a schedule in excel easily. Rather than putting all headings and timings in excel this app does that for you very easily. Think of it as a template to excel.


This GUI is made in python tkinter and uses pandas, os and csv module as well.

The basic functioning of this GUI is that you first start by saving a csv file in your chosen directory. Python will then enter the headings and timings in it on its own (it saves you that bit of the hastle). You are then directed to the page where you can start entering tasks by putting in timmings, day and title of the task. Pandas will use this information to edit the csv file.
You can also choose to view this file by opening it using the command: os.startfile()

Thank You!
